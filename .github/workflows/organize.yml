# Run very two hours between 5:00 and 22:00 UTC or by manual dispatch
# The most frequent a scheduled GitHub workflow can run is every 5 minutes
# However, with the monthly 2.000 computing minutes quota for free GitHub accounts
# and an estimated average run time of this workflow of 5 minutes at generous photographing,
# a schedule of every second hour during day time or less is highly recommended

  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '43 5-22/2 * * *'

# If the job takes longer, queue the next execution to prevent overlapping, conflicting runs
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}

# The configuration is completely outsourced into GitHub Action variables and secrets
# This allows to update the settings without altering the scripts or pushing changes to the repository
# Never expose any sensitive information directly, and always use GitHub secrets where necessary
